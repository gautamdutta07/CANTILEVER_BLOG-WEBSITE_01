    title: "The Evolution of Modern Design Systems",
    content: `
      <p>Design systems have become the backbone of modern digital product development. They provide a shared language between designers and developers, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints of a user's journey.</p>
      
      <h2>What Makes a Great Design System?</h2>
      <p>A well-crafted design system goes beyond just colors and typography. It encompasses the entire user experience, from micro-interactions to comprehensive component libraries that scale across platforms.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Typography hierarchy and font selections</li>
        <li>Color palettes with semantic meaning</li>
        <li>Spacing and layout principles</li>
        <li>Interactive components and states</li>
        <li>Icon libraries and illustration styles</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The most successful design systems are those that evolve with the product and organization. They're living documents that grow and adapt while maintaining their core principles.</p>
      
      <h2>Implementation Strategies</h2>
      <p>Building a design system requires careful planning and stakeholder buy-in. Start small with foundational elements and gradually expand based on actual needs and usage patterns.</p>
      
      <p>Remember, the goal isn't to create the most comprehensive system possible, but rather to solve real problems and improve the efficiency of your design and development workflow.</p>
